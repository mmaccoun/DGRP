# DGRP
Using data from https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE67505

The purpose of this project is to better understand the biological validity of a binary sex category. I am using transcriptome 
data from the DGRP lines to determine if it is possible to build a model which can predict sex accurately with transcriptome
data.
